**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 241K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

This is a research paper on the topic of regularization in signal processing, specifically in the context of band-limited extrapolation. The authors propose a new regularization technique for band-limited extrapolation and present experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Background**: Band-limited extrapolation is an ill-posed problem that involves estimating a signal from noisy measurements.
2. **Regularization technique**: The authors propose a regularization technique based on the regularized Fourier transform, which is a smoothing functional that minimizes the error between the estimated and true signals.
3. **Convergence property**: The authors prove that the regularized filtering formula converges to the exact Fourier transform as the regularization parameter approaches zero.
4. **Numerical results**: The authors present experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed regularization technique with a standard convolution method.

The paper appears to be well-written and provides a clear explanation of the regularization technique and its convergence property. However, it may be of interest to readers who are familiar with signal processing and regularization techniques.

Some potential areas for improvement:

1. **Context**: The paper assumes some background knowledge in signal processing and regularization techniques. Readers without this expertise may find the introduction challenging.
2. **Experimental design**: While the experimental results are presented, they may not be sufficient to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Additional experiments or comparisons with other methods could strengthen the paper's conclusions.
3. **Theoretical contributions**: The paper primarily focuses on the practical application of regularization techniques. Readers interested in theoretical contributions may find the paper lacking in this regard.

Overall, the paper presents a well-written and well-structured contribution to the field of signal processing and regularization techniques.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study aims to estimate residential outdoor water use using smart water meter data. The authors used hourly demand data from 18,000 residential accounts in Lakewood, CA, over two years to develop estimates of indoor water use and calculate outdoor water use patterns. They applied three methods: Minimum Day Method-Network (MDM-N), Minimum Day Method-Account (MDM-A), and Minimum Hour Method-Network (MHM-N). The results show that outdoor water use ranges from 31% to 41% of total demand using the MDM-N, MDM-A, and MHM-N methods.

# Alghamdi et al. - 2024 - Dynamic Pricing Framework for Water Demand Management Using Advanced Metering Infrastructure Data.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.49M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This research investigates the use of dynamic pricing as a demand management tool to reduce cost and increase the lifespan of water distribution systems by reducing peak hour demand. The study uses advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data to simulate individual consumer responses to changes in hourly water price. A hydraulic simulation model is used to evaluate the effects of changing demands on flows and in-network metrics. The framework is applied to Lakewood City, California, using a model of the pipe network and AMI data collected at nearly 20,000 accounts.

The study addresses the research gap of how dynamic pricing can be effectively implemented to manage water demand and reduce peak hour demand. The challenges include accommodating potential growth in water demand through existing infrastructure capacity. The results show that reductions in morning peak demand ranging from 6% to 25% reduce peak energy demands.

# Attallah et al. - 2023 - An Open-Source, Semisupervised Water End-Use Disaggregation and Classification Tool.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.72M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper presents a new open-source, semisupervised water end-use disaggregation and classification tool. The authors aim to address the unavailability of code and data used by prior studies in this field. The tool was developed in Python and can be accessed via any current Python programming environment. The base disaggregation and classification model for the tool was developed and tested on high-temporal-resolution data for a single home, where manually labeled end-use event data were also collected. The tool was then applied to four additional homes selected from a larger dataset to demonstrate its generalizability.

The authors used a semisupervised classification approach to overcome the challenges associated with classifying events. They employed a relatively small number of manually labeled events to show how a semisupervised model can be developed. The results showed that the tool can disaggregate and classify high-temporal-resolution data into individual end-use events.

# Cardell-Oliver - 2013 - Discovering water use activities for smart metering.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 709K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper introduces a new method for discovering water use activities from real-world smart water meter observations. The authors address several constraints that distinguish their work from previous studies, including the lack of labelled training data and the availability of only automatically collected hourly readings. They propose a scalable approach using data mining techniques to recognize significant activities given only automatically gathered observations.

The paper focuses on three main categories of water use: continuous flow (at least 2 litres per hour), peak days (above the population median daily total), and normal days (excluding continuous flow and peak days). The authors also introduce hierarchical clustering to identify meaningful activity patterns from coarse-grained hourly readings.

The study demonstrates the utility of their activity discovery method using a real-world case study of over 35,000 example days from a smart water meter trial in Kalgoorlie Boulder. The results show that the new method is able to discover significant and meaningful activity patterns from coarse-grained hourly readings.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

The paper "A Fast and Elitist Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm NSGA-II" by Kalyanmoy Deb et al. (2002) presents a fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm called NSGA-II. The authors aim to alleviate the difficulties of existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as nondominated sorting approach, nonelitism, and sharing parameter specification.

The paper discusses the limitations of existing MOEAs and proposes a new approach that combines nondominated sorting with a selection operator to create a mating pool. The algorithm also uses crowding distance to maintain diversity in the population.

The authors present simulation results on difficult test problems, showing that NSGA-II can find better spread of solutions and convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to other MOEAs. They also modify the definition of dominance to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently.

# Deoreo and Mayer - 2012 - Insights into declining single‐family residential water demands.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 736K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This article presents key data and findings from a 16-year data collection effort on single-family residential water demands. The study aims to understand the trends in water use over time and identify potential opportunities for future demand reductions. The authors analyze data from four studies, including the Residential End Use Study (REUWS), the Combined Survey of Faucets and Water Fixtures (CSF), the California Save Water Partnership (CSFWUES), and the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The study reveals that water use in single-family residences has declined since 1995, with significant reductions in indoor and outdoor demands. The authors identify several factors contributing to these declines, including the adoption of high-efficiency fixtures and appliances, changes in showering and washing habits, and improved designs of household plumbing systems.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper, case study, new method

**Paper Summary:**

The paper "WEUSEDTO—Water End USE Dataset and TOols" by Anna Di Mauro et al. presents an open water end use consumption dataset and a set of tools to analyze high-resolution water data. The dataset combines real-time measurement data from household fixtures with 1-second time resolution, providing a unique opportunity for researchers and water utilities to develop tailored machine learning models for water data.

The authors highlight the need for innovative algorithms and techniques to manage and forecast water demand, particularly in residential environments. They introduce the WEUSEDTO software, organized into four Python packages: timeseries, model, learning, and simulation. The software allows users to detect fixture usage, compute statistical parameters, and simulate water consumption at different scales.

The paper aims to provide a starting point for researchers and water utilities to develop machine learning models for water data, validate disaggregation algorithms, and implement innovative management strategies. By providing a detailed demand profiling and forecasting, the authors aim to optimize water supply and reduce costs, pressure, and water losses.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper presents HydroSense, a low-cost and easily-installed single-point sensor of pressure within a home's water infrastructure. The authors aim to sense human activity in the physical world using existing infrastructures, such as water pipes. They evaluate their approach using data collected in ten homes and achieve 97.9% aggregate accuracy in identifying fixture events.

The paper focuses on infrastructure-mediated sensing of home water activity, which is essential for various ubiquitous computing applications. The authors identify individual water fixtures within a home using unique pressure waves that propagate to the sensor when valves are opened or closed. They also estimate the amount of water being used at each fixture based on the magnitude of the resulting pressure drop.

The authors propose a template-based hierarchical classifier to associate valve open and close events with individual fixtures in a home. They use four distance metrics (matched filter, matched derivative filter, real Cepstrum, and simple mean squared error) to filter potential templates and classify unknown events. The paper evaluates the fixture classification using an experimental design across multiple homes.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.1M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study aims to perform a comprehensive quantitative comparison of several supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques for residential water end-use classification. The authors create a common database using a stochastic simulation tool based on real consumption data. They evaluate the performance of various ML techniques, including clustering, SVMs, and regression, on this dataset.

The results show that while unsupervised methods alone are not sufficient to detect the correct end-uses of domestic water consumption fully automatically, supervised ML techniques can be an efficient way to perform water end-use classification. The authors conclude that incorporating prior knowledge as much as possible is essential for the experiment set-up of residential water end-use classification.

**Table 7: Confusion matrices for the binary SVMs**

The table shows the confusion matrices for the binary SVMs, which are used to evaluate the performance of the ML techniques on the test data. The rows correspond to the end-use labels, and the columns correspond to the predicted labels. The values in the table represent the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class.

**Conclusion:**

The study highlights the importance of incorporating prior knowledge into the experiment set-up of residential water end-use classification. Supervised ML techniques can be an efficient way to perform water end-use classification, but unsupervised methods alone are not sufficient to detect the correct end-uses fully automatically.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 3.71M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study investigates whether smart water meter temporal resolution is a limiting factor to residential water end-use classification. The authors analyze the performance of machine learning models for classifying different types of household water uses (e.g., showers, washing machines, toilets) using data from a single-family home with a custom smart water meter.

The researchers first visualize the time-of-day and day-of-week distribution of three major classes of events (shower, washing machine, and dishwasher) to identify regular patterns of consumption. They then train separate models for each temporal resolution (from 1 second to 5 minutes) using k-fold cross-validation and evaluate their performance using F1-score metrics.

The results show that coarser temporal resolutions can improve model performance, with weighted F1-scores above 0.85 obtained at 1- and 5-second resolutions. The authors conclude that disaggregating and classifying water events from residential smart water meter data can provide detailed information about household water consumption patterns, which can inform water conservation and efficiency decisions.

# Hussien et al. - 2016 - Assessing and Modelling the Influence of Household Characteristics on Per Capita Water Consumption.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 2.35M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study assesses and models the influence of household characteristics on per capita water consumption. The research aims to identify the factors that affect water usage in households, with a focus on developing a model that can predict per capita water consumption based on demographic and physical characteristics of the household.

The study uses data from 407 households in Malaysia, which are divided into three income groups: low, medium, and high. The researchers use multiple linear regression (STEPWISE) and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) to develop models that predict per capita water consumption based on various household characteristics, including demographic factors such as the number of children, elders, adult males, and females, and physical factors such as total household built-up area, garden area, number of rooms, and per capita income.

The results show that the developed models are sensitive to per capita income, number of children, and number of adult males in the households. The study also explores four alternative scenarios on domestic water demand estimation, including market forces, fortress world, great transition (a), and others.

**Table 8: Coefficients of determination (R2) of the final regression models**

The table shows the R2 values for the developed models, which indicate the proportion of variance in per capita water consumption that is explained by the model. The results show that the EPR models have higher R2 values than the STEPWISE models, indicating that they are more accurate in predicting per capita water consumption.

**Conclusion:**

The study provides insights into the factors that affect water usage in households and develops a model that can predict per capita water consumption based on demographic and physical characteristics of the household. The results have implications for water resources management and policy-making, particularly in developing countries where water demand is often uncertain and difficult to predict.

# Johnson and Belitz - 2012 - A remote sensing approach for estimating the location and rate of urban irrigation in semi-arid clim.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 2.89M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper presents a new approach for estimating the location and rate of urban irrigation in semi-arid climates using remote sensing techniques. The authors use a combination of satellite imagery, air photos, climatic records, and land-use maps to identify irrigated areas and estimate the monthly rate of irrigation being applied to those areas. The approach provides a repeatable methodology at a 1/3 km2 scale across a large urbanized area (500 km2). The authors use a linear-mixture model to estimate the fraction of irrigated landscaping in urban areas, which is then used to calculate the monthly rate of irrigation.

The study focuses on the San Fernando Valley in Southern California and uses data from 29 satellite scenes, air photos, and a land-use map. The authors identify two land-cover categories: impervious hardscape (consisting of rooftops, driveways, side-walks, streets, etc.) and irrigated landscaping (defined as areas under or potentially under the influence of irrigation). They also use a three-endmember linear-mixture model to estimate the NDVI values for these endmembers.

The results show that the approach is successful in estimating the location and rate of urban irrigation, with an accuracy of 95% compared to hand-digitized data. The authors conclude that this approach provides a useful tool for monitoring water usage at the regional and sub-watershed scales.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper, written by M. Kowalski and D. Marshallsay in 2005, reviews the use of measured microcomponent data to model the impact of water conservation strategies on diurnal consumption profiles. The authors discuss the importance of understanding domestic water use patterns, particularly at the microcomponent level, to plan and manage water supply effectively.

The study analyzed a dataset from the Water Research Centre (WRc) involving 13 water companies and the UK Environment Agency, which provided information on microcomponents of water use in domestic properties in the UK. The analysis revealed diurnal variations in water use at the microcomponent level and identified key factors influencing water consumption, such as occupancy and socioeconomic class.

The authors developed a model to simulate the diurnal demand pattern of areas of the water supply network and investigated the impact of different demand reduction strategies on each microcomponent for that area. The study showed that potentially large water users during peak periods are likely to be from affluent households with detached properties and garden sprinklers.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This review paper by Lunstad and Sowby (2024) examines the effectiveness of smart irrigation controllers in residential applications. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of 80 studies on residential applications of smart irrigation controllers, which demonstrated typical savings of 15% among general users and more than 40% among indulgent users. Soil moisture sensors paired with rain sensors have shown the highest water savings potential when connected with smart irrigation controllers.

The study highlights the need for further research on peak demand reduction, centralized communication, data verifiability, and human factors of landscape management. The authors also discuss the potential of integrated water distribution systems (IWDS), which could utilize smart irrigation controllers as direct load control devices at customer endpoints and interface with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems at a central location.

## Summary

**Type:** Original Research

**Paper Summary:**

The paper "The role of knowledge about water consumption in the context of intentions to use IoT water metrics" by Madias et al. (2022) investigates how consumers' perceived knowledge on water usage influences their intention to adopt smart (IoT-based) water meters, which deliver precise data on water usage in households. The authors hypothesized that perceived knowledge on personal water usage exerts a direct and indirect influence on the intention to adopt a smart water meter. They used structural equation modeling to analyze a sample of 532 respondents and found that perceived knowledge on water usage directly influences the intention to adopt a smart water meter, and that all considered variables work to mediate the relationship between perceived knowledge and intention.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This article addresses the need to divide a population of water utility customers into groups based on their similarities and differences, using only the measured flow data collected by water meters. The authors introduce a method of agglomerative clustering using information-theoretic distance measures on Gaussian mixture models within a reconstructed phase space, designed to accommodate a utility's limited human, financial, computational, and environmental resources.

The proposed weighted variation of information distance measure for comparing Gaussian mixture models emphasizes those behaviors whose statistical distributions are more compact over those behaviors with large variation. The authors conduct several experiments with both synthetic and real data to show the reasonableness of the clustering results and their consistency.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 925K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** New method

**Paper Summary:**

This paper presents an automated methodology for disaggregating household water-use data into end uses using a rule-based approach. The methodology was developed and tested with data collected from four households in Bologna, Italy, over a period of two months. The authors used 1-minute temporal resolution smart meter data, which is slightly lower than the typical granularity used in other methodologies.

The methodology involves applying a series of rules to identify and classify water uses into different end-use categories, such as dishwasher, washing machine, shower, toilet, and tap use. The rules are based on parameters such as duration, volume, frequency, and time of day of each water use. The authors used a combination of manual and automated approaches to develop the rules, which were then tested and validated using the collected data.

The results showed that the methodology was able to efficiently disaggregate household water-use data even when detailed information about end-use features was not available. The authors also found that the methodology was robust and could handle variations in water use patterns across different households.

# Meyer et al. - 2020 - Extracting household water use event characteristics from rudimentary data.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 482K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study aims to extract household water use event characteristics from rudimentary data, which is defined as data recorded in intervals longer than 1 min or with resolutions larger than 0.1 L/pulse. The authors conducted a case study in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, where they equipped 63 homes with iPERL smart water meters that recorded flow measurements every 15 s at a 1 L/pulse resolution. They extracted 1,107,547 event pulses over a 217-day study period and developed a tool called PEET (Pulse Event Extraction Tool) to automate the process of extracting event characteristics.

The authors found that minor events represented 76% of the number of events extracted, with an average of nine notable end-uses per person per day. They also found that the total volume of all events was attributed to minor events. The study highlights the limitations of dealing with rudimentary data and the need for a robust method to classify end-use events.

**Conclusion:**

The authors conclude that household water end-use event characteristics can be extracted from rudimentary data using the PEET tool. However, they also acknowledge the limitations of their study, including the fact that minor events had to be grouped together and could not be further analyzed. The study provides valuable insights into the challenges of dealing with rudimentary data and highlights the need for further research in this area.

**References:**

The paper references several previous studies on water end-uses, including Buchberger and Wells (2013), Cominola et al. (2017), DeOreo et al. (2009), Loh and Coghlan (2015), Mayer et al. (1999), Nguyen et al. (2013), and Otaki et al. (2016).

# Meyer et al. - 2021 - Classifying household water use into indoor and outdoor use from a rudimentary data set a case stud.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 218K **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Research Paper Summary**

The paper "Classifying Household Water Use into Indoor and Outdoor Use" by Meyer et al. (2021) presents a study on classifying household water use into indoor and outdoor use using machine learning algorithms.

**Background** Household water use is a significant component of urban water demand, and accurate classification of indoor and outdoor water use can help optimize water distribution and reduce waste. However, existing methods often rely on manual surveys or limited data, which may not capture the complexity of household water use patterns.

**Methodology** The authors used two machine learning algorithms: PEET (Predicting End-Use Events from Time Series) to extract end-use events from a rudimentary data set and WEAM (Water End-Use Algorithmic Model) to classify extracted end-uses into indoor or outdoor use. The study focused on 11 homes in Johannesburg, South Africa.

**Results** The results show that:

- PEET was successful in extracting end-use events from the rudimentary data set.
- However, a large portion of the total water demand (24.2%) was not classified.
- Outdoor use was identified at all 11 homes, even though some residents did not report any garden irrigation.

**Conclusion** The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to classify household water use into indoor and outdoor use. The results highlight the importance of using robust classification tools to monitor water restrictions and optimize water distribution in urban areas.

**Recommendations**

- Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of end-use event extraction and classification.
- The study suggests that machine learning algorithms can be used as an additional method to help monitor household water use and enforce water restrictions.
- The findings have implications for urban water planning, water conservation, and efficient water distribution systems.

# Mini et al. - 2014 - Estimation of residential outdoor water use in Los Angeles, California.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 3.53M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study aims to estimate residential outdoor water use in Los Angeles, California. The authors analyze existing methods for estimating outdoor use and landscape irrigation in highly developed residential areas across Los Angeles. They provide a comparison of outdoor use estimates from Los Angeles water billing data with estimates of outdoor use including a CDWR estimate of outdoor use, DeOreo et al. (2011), Mayer and DeOreo (1999), and Salvador et al. (2011). The study also investigates the correlation of NDVI surplus with socio-economic variables to better understand which variables are captured by NDVI surplus.

The authors find that there is a statistically significant downward trend in landscaping irrigation over FY2008-FY2010, except for two neighborhoods: Silver Lake (SLL) does not have a statistically significant trend, and Playa Vista (PLV) has a positive trend. The average slope across the selected neighborhoods is equal to a decrease of 0.0072 (or 3% of average NDVI surplus) over a year.

The study also finds that income is correlated with NDVI surplus, with a correlation equal to 0.58 (p \< 0.05), showing that a greener landscape and higher income are related. The percent Hispanic or Latino origin residents per tract is negatively correlated with NDVI surplus, with a correlation equal to -0.57 (p \< 0.05).

**Method:**

The study uses remote sensing data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Landsat satellite to estimate NDVI surplus. The authors also use socio-economic variables such as income, household size, and percent Hispanic or Latino origin residents per tract.

**Results:**

The study finds that there is a large spatial variation in landscaping irrigation change per tract over the city. A higher decrease in irrigation is expected during the FY2010 period. The results indicate that the increase in irrigation observed in some tracts for these two water restrictions periods may be due to uncertainties in the model or restrictions not being efficient in these areas.

The study also finds that the average expected percent change in landscaping irrigation was higher for the lower income group than for the higher income group, from -4% respectively (Table 5).

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

The paper "Water end-use consumption in low-income households: Evaluation of the impact of preprocessing on the construction of a classification model" by Karla Oliveira-Esquerre et al. (2021) evaluates the impact of preprocessing on the construction of a classification model for water end-use consumption in low-income households. The authors discuss the challenges of transforming massive water flow data into desegregated smart information according to water end uses, particularly in low-income regions where hydraulic devices exhibit high variability.

The paper reviews existing methods for classifying water events and highlights limitations such as poor performance due to difficulties in separating events correctly in space and similar features of different devices. The authors propose two new classification methods: ERP (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and a Random Forest (RF) model, which are presented in the following section.

The authors evaluate the performance of their proposed models using real-world data from low-income households in Brazil. The results show that both models achieved high accuracy rates for events and volume consumed, with the RF model outperforming the 1NNERP model in some cases.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 2.82M **Modified:** 2025-11-07 14:11:37

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This paper presents a novel methodology for automatic water end use disaggregation through two main processes: disaggregation and classification. The disaggregation process focuses on an advanced two-stage filtering based on the algorithm described in Pastor et al. \[21\], which is calibrated using the Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm NSGA-II \[22\]. A new cropping algorithm is also proposed, having as input the filtered water consumption flow traces.

The classification process involves analyzing the minimum/baseline flow (Qbase) in the filtered Filter-A events that have not been classified as simple events. The existence of a base event is considered when more than one horizontal section of the event satisfies certain conditions.

The authors analyze the performance of their separation process using two studies, R1 and R2, which involve 10 households each. They report that the disaggregation process can accurately classify single-use events, while overlapped events are cropped and separated into simpler single-use events.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

The paper "Residential End Uses of Water" is a review of the Residential End Uses of Water Study (REUWS), which aimed to provide specific data on the end uses of water in single-family residential settings across North America. The study collected data from 12 locations and analyzed the indoor and outdoor uses of water, including toilets, showers, clothes washers, faucets, lawn watering, and other purposes.

The study found that a small number of homes were responsible for the majority of leaks, with an average daily leakage rate of 21.9 gallons per household per day. The median leakage rate was only 4.2 gallons per household per day. Outdoor use followed a diurnal pattern similar to overall water use, but with some differences.

The study also analyzed the indoor and outdoor use patterns, finding that faucet use is strongly related to household size, while dishwasher use is negatively related to the number of persons employed full-time outside the home. The study suggests that marginal price has a positive effect on faucet use, although the coefficient is not significant from a statistical perspective.

## Summary

**Type:** Review paper

**Paper Summary:**

This study assesses the impact of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) metering on end-use water conservation in leaky households. The authors designed and deployed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of AMI-based water user communication on water consumption. They found that AMI-enhanced messaging reduces end-use water consumption by 5.24 gallons per household per day, which is additive to the 3-5% savings obtained from smart water meters (HWRs). However, the financial savings from treatment are not sufficient to justify AMI installation costs in all homes.

The study also found that approximately 92.8% of the estimated water conservation is attributable to leak detection and repair. In households observed to have a leak prior to treatment, the intervention reduced daily water use by 30.0 gallons per household per day and led to annual savings of \$60. The reduction in leak frequency and leak duration explains a substantial portion of the 5.24 gallon per day treatment effect.
