# Bastidas Pacheco et al. - 2023 - Variability in Consumption and End Uses of Water for Residential Users in Logan and Providence, Utah.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 5.38M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this study is to assess the variability in residential water consumption and end uses of water for households in Logan and Providence, Utah.

**Research Gap**: Previous studies on residential end-use of water have often collected data for periods that may not capture temporal variations in indoor and outdoor water use practices. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing four to six weeks of high-temporal-resolution data from 31 single-family residential customers in Logan and Providence.

**Methodology**: The researchers used a disaggregation and classification algorithm to identify the end uses of water for each household. They found that single-family residential water use varied throughout the year, peaking in July with average monthly values close to 125,000 L in Logan and 220,000 L in Providence. Outdoor water use drives the increase in residential water use observed during summer months.

**Findings**: The study found that:

-   Inefficient toilet events were common at all sites, with 23 of the 31 sites having more than 50% inefficient toilet events.
-   The percentage of efficient toilets varied across participant cities, suggesting geographical factors influenced toilet performance.
-   Faucet events were the third largest category of indoor water use by volume, and most faucet events were short duration and low flow rate.
-   Dishwasher cycles were indistinguishable from faucet events and were lumped in with them.

**Conclusion**: The study highlights the importance of considering outdoor water use in estimating total residential water demand. It also suggests that geographical factors can influence toilet performance, and future studies should investigate this further. Additionally, the study's findings have implications for improving water efficiency in residential settings.

**Limitations**: The study was limited by the lack of data at the city level, which made it difficult to assess differences in water use between Logan and Providence. The researchers also did not collect data during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have impacted participants' schedules.

**Recommendations for Future Research**: Further studies should investigate the impact of geographical factors on toilet performance and explore ways to improve the classification method used in this study. Additionally, studies that consider outdoor water use in estimating total residential water demand are needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of water use patterns and behavior within individual households.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 2.02M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of the paper "A novel mixed method smart metering approach to reconciling differences between perceived and actual residential end use water consumption" by Beal et al. (2013) is to investigate the relationship between householders' perceptions of their water use and their actual water use.

**Research Gap**: There has been limited research on how householders' perceptions of their water use compare to their actual water use, particularly in terms of specific categories of end use and socio-demographic and socio-psychological factors.

**Approach**: The authors used a mixed-methods approach, combining high-resolution smart metering data with surveys, stock inventory audits, and self-reported measures. They analyzed the data using software that could distinguish between two simultaneous events and generated a database registry of end-use event information for each home.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The study found that households with higher incomes tend to install water-efficient technology, but this does not necessarily lead to lower water consumption on a per-household basis. The authors also found that householders' perceptions of their water use are often not well matched with their actual water use, particularly for outdoor uses.

**Relevance to your review**: This study contributes to the understanding of how smart metering can be used to reconcile differences between perceived and actual water use, which is relevant to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and water event disaggregation. The findings highlight the importance of considering socio-demographic and socio-psychological factors in understanding water consumption behavior.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 204K **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach for analyzing household water consumption using medium resolution meter data, known as "water use signature patterns."

**Research Gap**: There is a need for accurate information about how water is being used in households, which is challenging due to the lack of detailed data. Smart meters are being deployed on a large scale by water providers to collect medium resolution data, but existing methods are not designed for this type of data.

**Approach**: The authors propose a technique for discovering patterns that explain how water is used in households using medium resolution meter data. They introduce four types of signature patterns: continuous flow days, exceptional peak use days, programmed patterns with recurrent hours, and normal use partitioned by season and period of the day.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The results demonstrate that water use behaviors are distinctive, both for individuals and populations. Signature patterns can identify behaviors that are promising targets for water conservation. Pattern discovery can be automated with an efficient and scalable computer program.

**Relevance to AMI, Outdoor Watering Detection, or Disaggregation**: This paper is relevant to the field of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) as it proposes a novel approach for analyzing household water consumption using medium resolution meter data. The technique can help achieve the water conservation potential of large-scale smart metering. Additionally, the paper's findings on identifying distinctive water use behaviors and patterns can be applied to outdoor watering event detection and water event disaggregation.

**Framework Summary**

The paper proposes a novel approach for characterizing household water consumption using medium resolution meter data. The approach is based on discovering patterns that explain how water is used in households, known as "water use signature patterns." The framework consists of four types of signature patterns: continuous flow days, exceptional peak use days, programmed patterns with recurrent hours, and normal use partitioned by season and period of the day. The technique can be automated using efficient and scalable computer programs.

**Pattern Metrics**

The paper introduces metrics for water use signature patterns, which measure neither volume nor time. Volume metrics characterize the significance of a pattern in absolute units (liters), while time metrics characterize the scale of a pattern in terms of the number of time units (days, periods, or hours) that the pattern occurs.

**Relative Significance and Population Measures**

The paper introduces relative significance and population measures for water use signature patterns. Relative significance is the ratio of metric function f to the sum of volumes observed in the cluster, while relative population measure is the ratio of the population measure for a pattern to that of the same measure (volume or time) for U, the complete set of observations from the whole population.

**Conclusion**

The paper demonstrates the utility of water use signature patterns for characterizing household water consumption. The technique can identify distinctive usage patterns of individuals and highlight behaviors that are promising targets for water conservation. Pattern discovery can be automated using efficient and scalable computer programs.

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.3M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this paper is to investigate household water consumption using smart metering systems.

**Research Gap**: Little is known about the effectiveness of demand management programs implemented by water authorities in reducing potable water supplies during prolonged droughts.

**Approach**: A sample of 10 volunteer households was installed with high-resolution smart meters and data loggers. The raw data were collected remotely and processed using special-purpose software to disaggregate every water event occurring in a household into relevant end-use categories.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: This study provides insight into itemized water consumption by each appliance during the monitoring period and evaluates the effectiveness of implemented water demand management programs. The results show that smart meters can provide detailed data about itemized water consumption in a household, which can be used to reveal the effectiveness of water conservation appliances and fixtures.

**Relevance to AMI/Disaggregation**: This study highlights the importance of WaterWise education as a crucial part of demand management programs, with changes in consumer behavior likely to save most water. The use of smart meters and disaggregation techniques provides valuable insights into household water consumption patterns, which can inform the development of effective demand management strategies.

**Detailed Content**

-   **Showerheads**: The study found that showerhead flow rates are lower than manufacturer's estimates, with ultra-low-flow showerheads performing well in reducing water usage.
-   **Showers**: The average duration of showers is 7.2 ± 4 minutes, with most showers exceeding the recommended 4-minute duration.
-   **Water Conservation**: The study suggests that ongoing monitoring programs can encourage residents to be accountable for their water use and behavior, leading to significant indoor water savings through the installation of high-efficiency plumbing fixtures and appliances.

**Limitations**: The study is a pilot project with a small sample size, and further research is needed to extend the findings to a larger number of households with diverse community members.

# Newing et al. - 2023 - Smart water metering as a non-invasive tool to infer dwelling type and occupancy – Implications for.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 3.62M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this paper is to explore the potential of smart water metering data to infer dwelling type and occupancy patterns.

**Research Gap**: There has been limited research utilizing water consumption data for applications beyond consumption monitoring, demand reduction, and network management. However, studies have demonstrated a link between observable water consumption and dwelling occupancy.

**Approach**: The authors utilize high-temporal-resolution water consumption data from a sample of households in Devon and Cornwall, UK. They apply Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring (NIOM) to extract dwelling-level occupancy status on a day-by-day basis. The approach involves analyzing the number of usage events and daily mean volume of water consumed to identify properties with high or low occupancy patterns.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The authors successfully identified occupancy status for 98.7% of days in their manually labeled test data, capturing the proportion of days a property was occupied during a 12-month period. They grouped properties according to their occupancy trends and found four distinct groups, including those with high or low occupancy patterns.

**Relevance to AMI/Disaggregation**: This study highlights the potential for smart water metering data to infer dwelling type and occupancy patterns, which can have implications for accurate billing, network management, and energy efficiency. The authors' approach demonstrates a non-intrusive means of inferring occupancy patterns, which can be useful in various applications, including identifying tourist dwellings or second homes.

**Limitations**: The study assumes that properties retain their identified status throughout the analysis period, and there is no validation data capturing the actual status of any properties during the study period. However, the authors suggest that detecting a change in occupier could represent an interesting application of these data.

Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of research exploring the potential of smart water metering data for applications beyond traditional uses. By leveraging high-temporal-resolution water consumption data and NIOM, the authors demonstrate a non-intrusive approach to inferring dwelling type and occupancy patterns, which can have significant implications for various stakeholders in the water supply sector.

# Pavlou et al. - 2024 - Monitoring domestic water consumption a comparative study of model-based and data-driven end-use di.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.03M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this paper is to present two different methods for disaggregating end-use consumption and classifying consumption events in domestic water usage.

**Research Gap**: The study addresses the challenges of monitoring domestic water consumption, particularly in identifying individual appliances and their usage patterns. Existing methods often rely on manual data analysis or require significant computational resources, making them impractical for real-time applications.

**Approach**: The authors propose two methods: model-based (MB) and learning-based (LB). The MB method uses dynamic time wrapping and statistical bounds to analyze four water end-use characteristics, while the LB method formulates the problem as a time-series classification problem without relying on prior event identification. Both methods are compared in terms of their accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The study demonstrates that both methods achieve similar F1 scores (LB: 71.73%, MB: 71.04%) with the LB method being more precise. The embedded LB method achieves a slightly higher score (72.01%) while enhancing on-site real-time processing, improving security and privacy, and enabling cost savings.

**Relevance to AMI/Disaggregation**: This paper contributes to the development of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) by proposing novel methods for disaggregating end-use consumption in domestic water usage. The study's findings have implications for optimizing water consumption patterns, reducing waste, and promoting water conservation.

# Rosenberg et al. - 2007 - Modeling integrated water user decisions in intermittent supply systems.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 1.11M **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of the paper "Modeling integrated water user decisions in intermittent supply systems" by Rosenberg et al. (2007) is to develop a systems analysis that integrates multiple sources having different costs, availabilities, reliabilities, and qualities; many conservation options; and interdependent water user behaviors.

**Research Gap**: The existing literature on water use modeling has given little systematic attention to sources, availabilities, reliabilities, qualities, conservation options, and local storage in intermittent supply systems. This study aims to address this gap by considering these factors in a comprehensive analysis.

**Approach**: The authors present a stochastic optimization program with recourse decisions that identifies the infrastructure investments and short-term coping actions a customer can adopt to cost-effectively respond to a probability distribution of piped water availability. They also use Monte Carlo simulations to show effects for a population of customers.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The study finds that model calibration reproduces the distribution of billed residential water use in Amman, Jordan. Parametric analyses suggest economic and demand responses to increased availability and alternative pricing. Additionally, the authors discuss new insights to size, target, and finance conservation actions.

**Relevance to AMI, Outdoor Watering Detection, or Disaggregation**: This study contributes to the development of smart water metering by considering the complex interactions between water users and their environment. The approach can be applied to other areas of water management, such as outdoor watering detection and demand-side management.

# Suero et al. - 2012 - Estimating and Verifying United States Households’ Potential to Conserve Water.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 424K **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of Suero et al.'s paper is to estimate and verify the potential for United States households to conserve water.

**Research Gap**: The study addresses the gap in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of residential water conservation measures, particularly in identifying which households have the greatest potential to save water through behavioral changes and technological improvements.

**Approach**: Suero et al. employed a case study approach, collecting detailed end-use data on water use before and after retrofits of toilets, showers, clothes washers, and faucets in 96 owner-occupied single-family households in three locations (Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; and Tampa, Florida). They used regression and hybrid models to estimate water savings and compared the results with observed differences.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The study found that:

-   Observed and predicted distributions of water savings are skewed, with a small number of households showing potential to save more water.
-   Regression and hybrid model results indicate that both technological (flow rates of appliances) and behavioral (length of use, frequency of use) factors significantly influence water saved.
-   Household characteristics, such as the number of residents, performance, and frequency of appliance use, distinguish households with high water-saving potential from those with low potential.

**Relevance to AMI/Disaggregation**: This study contributes to the development of engineering methods for estimating water savings from retrofits and provides insights into identifying subcategories of households that have potential to save more water. The findings can inform water utilities in targeting conservation efforts and developing effective demand management strategies.

The paper highlights the importance of considering both technological and behavioral factors in estimating water savings, which is relevant to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and water event disaggregation. By identifying the most water-efficient households, utilities can focus on targeted interventions to maximize overall water conservation.

# Syme et al. - 2004 - Predicting and understanding home garden water use.pdf

**Extension:** pdf **Size:** 88.6K **Modified:** 2025-11-10 10:02:07

## Summary

**Research Objective**: The primary goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between household attitudes towards gardening and their external water consumption.

**Research Gap**: Despite previous studies examining the correlation between garden-based attitudes and total household water consumption, there is a lack of research on the specific relationship between attitudes towards gardening and external water use in home gardens.

**Approach**: The authors employed Structural Equation Modeling with latent variables to examine the relationships between socio-demographic variables, quality of life variables, and external water use. They used Factor-based Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection.

**Key Findings/Contributions**: The study found that attitudes towards gardening were not significant predictors of external water consumption, contradicting previous studies. However, the authors suggest that this may be due to the measurement error in their data or the fact that they only measured water use during winter months when garden watering was minimal.

**Relevance to AMI/Disaggregation**: This study highlights the importance of considering quality of life and social factors in understanding water consumption patterns. It also emphasizes the need for more research on the specific relationship between attitudes towards gardening and external water use, which could inform policies related to demand management and supply reliability.

Note: The paper focuses on understanding the relationship between household attitudes towards gardening and their external water consumption, rather than directly addressing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) or water event disaggregation. However, the study's findings on the importance of considering quality of life and social factors in understanding water consumption patterns are relevant to these topics.
